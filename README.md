# Obect_Detection_in_UAVs

As a team, we competed in Teknofest, Turkey's most comprehensive technology and competition festival.
These 2 projects contain the codes for object detection and tracking during the flight of our UAV-UCAV teams,
where I worked for 2 years and led the software department. 

As you see, we've worked with YOLOv3 algorithm techniques to create our model, process the images, 
tracking the trajectory in line with the coordinates given in the competition directive.
